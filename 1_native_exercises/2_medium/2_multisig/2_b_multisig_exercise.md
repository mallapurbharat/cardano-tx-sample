# Multisig transaction
This sample tries to explain how to submit a more complex transaction where funds from a multi-sig policy script are transferred to user4. the policy stipulates that 3 users with addresses - payment1, payment2, payment3 need to authorize the transaction for it to succeed.

The transaction requires use of the witness-override and witness signing feature of cardano-cli

## High level steps

1. create 3 addresses - payment1, payment2, payment3 verification key, signing key, staking key
### 2. create a 4th user who will get paid - payment4 verification key, signing key, staking key
3. generate a key hash for the verification keys for payment1,payment2, payment3.
4. create a multisig script which stipulates that all 3 addresses need to sign the transaction
5. create a script address for this script.
6. fund it with testAda
7. check if funds received in the script address by querying for it's utxos
8. create variable to store txid and index of the utxo
9. build a transaction with witness-override set to 3
10. have each of the users payment1,2,3 witness this transaction
11. assemble the transaction to use the raw transaction, witness files together as a signed transaction
12. submit the transaction.
13. verify the balance of address payment4

## Actual Steps

##### First generate all the account keys that are required (can be skipped if you already have 3 separate addressess setup)
```
cardano-cli address key-gen --verification-key-file payment1.vkey --signing-key-file payment1.skey
cardano-cli stake-address key-gen --verification-key-file stake1.vkey --signing-key-file stake1.skey

cardano-cli address key-gen --verification-key-file payment2.vkey --signing-key-file payment2.skey
cardano-cli address key-gen --verification-key-file payment3.vkey --signing-key-file payment3.skey

cardano-cli stake-address key-gen --verification-key-file stake2.vkey --signing-key-file stake2.skey

KEYHASH1=$(cardano-cli address key-hash --payment-verification-key-file payment1.vkey)
KEYHASH2=$(cardano-cli address key-hash --payment-verification-key-file payment2.vkey)
KEYHASH3=$(cardano-cli address key-hash --payment-verification-key-file payment3.vkey)```
```

##### create a new file called multisigpolicy.script and add the contents as below then fill out the values of KEYHASH1, 2, 3 in the content and save the file

##### NOTE: If you don't replace <KEYHASHX> with an actual key hash, then your script might fail with a cryptic error!
  
```
{
  "type": "all",
  "scripts":
  [
    {
      "type": "sig",
      "keyHash": "<KEYHASH1>"
    },
    {
      "type": "sig",
      "keyHash": "<KEYHASH2>"
    },
    {
      "type": "sig",
      "keyHash": "<KEYHASH3>"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### now we build a script address from the script

`cardano-cli address build --payment-script-file exampletxs/multisigpolicy.script $TESTNET --out-file exampletxs/multisig.addr`

##### now use the [ADA Testnet faucet](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/) to fund this script address with 1000 Ada.

##### check if the funds have been received of 1000 Ada
`cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat exampletxs/multisig.addr) $TESTNET`

##### take the txid and index and concat them into  a variable UTXO1
`UTXO1=1978adb5f11e9eb8df3042a20c94fa0a7967bc48a487d64c656710ecb895197a#0`


##### build the basic transaction. note the witness-override option
`cardano-cli transaction build --babbage-era --tx-in $UTXO1 --change-address $(cat payment4.addr) --tx-in-script-file exampletxs/multisigpolicy.script --witness-override 3 --out-file txmultisig.raw $TESTNET`

##### view the transaction details
`cardano-cli transaction view --tx-body-file txmultisig.raw`

##### witness the transaction by each user
```
cardano-cli transaction witness --signing-key-file payment1.skey --tx-body-file txmultisig.raw  --out-file payment1.witness

cardano-cli transaction witness --signing-key-file payment2.skey --tx-body-file txmultisig.raw  --out-file payment2.witness

cardano-cli transaction witness --signing-key-file payment3.skey --tx-body-file txmultisig.raw  --out-file payment3.witness
```

##### now assemble all the witness sigs into the transaction
`cardano-cli transaction assemble --tx-body-file txmultisig.raw --witness-file payment1.witness --witness-file payment2.witness --witness-file payment3.witness --out-file txmultisig.signed`

##### now submit the transaction finally
```
cardano-cli transaction submit --tx-file txmultisig.signed $TESTNET
cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment4.addr) $TESTNET
```
Additional step: search for the multisig script address on testnet.cardanoscan.io, you should see a "Contract" heading for the address, and a verify button next to it. Click on the verify button, select the "Native script", this will open up a new window. paste the entire JSON for the multiscript file into the box and click on "Verify". 
  
  
Hope you had fun doing this exercise!
